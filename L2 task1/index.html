    <h1>ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORD SYSTEM</h1>
    <p>
        A medical record system contains a variety of "notes" that have been added over time with the assistance of healthcare professionals, as well as information on the administration, monitoring, and recording of medications and therapies, prescriptions for their administration, test results, x-rays, reports, and other information. Basic information like your name and birth date might be found in your medical records <a href="https://www.googleadservices.com/pagead/aclk?sa=L&ai=DChcSEwiunMjphfCGAxXqllAGHYNKB1gYABAAGgJkZw&ase=2&gclid=CjwKCAjw7NmzBhBLEiwAxrHQ-dCT05ZRVeoC4rby9ZgqNAXC1gQQLFb_M_iSmqeQQz3AWq9DrrXfNxoCP0wQAvD_BwE&ohost=www.google.com&cid=CAESVuD2smSKYnnbYjB9iJpiznMoZ1oDX8n1siVwIPYSTUeZQXTmSR4lDw_ewPn3EcpOduuoYHHtWUvUmnk3JmEOZJmT2KvApz95ad8gIYC0S4dIa3i5K4yc&sig=AOD64_2J3y_vkN3afg0v-VtOLj4vNWlslQ&q&nis=4&adurl&ved=2ahUKEwiy9sLphfCGAxVzXEEAHc3tC3IQ0Qx6BAgJEAE">EMR software</a>. They also comprise the details you divulge to your general practitioner, dentist, or other professional when they examine your health. Medical personnel typically note symptoms and health issues that a patient exhibits during a consultation in paper medical records <a href="https://digital.ahrq.gov/electronic-medical-record-systems">EMRS</a>. The prevention, treatment, and cure of diseases are greatly aided by the information that has been stored. After the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA), the beginnings of the switch from paper to electronic medical records, which was introduced in 2009, started to emerge. In order to streamline access to patient records for doctors, physicians, and nurses, healthcare facilities around the country were required to modernize their internal recordkeeping processes and establish a consolidated database <a href="https://www.medesk.net/en/electronic-health-records-software/">EHRS</a>.
I started my research by looking at how various hospitals keep their record here in Nigeria. The common process of keeping record is physical, i.e., storing of paper files in the file room. Making the process of keeping data an intranet and not an internet mode of storage (cloud). My main target is to convert existing medical records (paper) into electronic medical records storage system, and to also make it a prerequisite for all patients to register so as to store their data directly to our locally created data base.

        MY LITERATURE REVIEW ON EMRS
    </h2>
    <p>
Millions of people's lives are currently at danger due to a number of health problems affecting the developing countries. Many of the developing nations that have been most severely impacted lack resources and effective healthcare systems. In response to recent statistics suggesting that treating the rising tide of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in developing countries is becoming more and more expensive, global initiatives with no specific goals, such as the Global Fund and the World Health Organization's (WHO) 3 by 5 Initiative, have begun to mobilize resources and personnel necessitates the immediate implementation of large-scale interventions (Hamish 2010). For these projects to quickly scale to thousands or potentially hundreds of thousands of patients, new care delivery methods are required, according to early lessons from treatment programs. Additionally, programs must assist healthcare professionals, many of whom have little training. 
The implementation of innovative therapies, chronic illness monitoring and follow-up, the acquisition of medications, and the reporting to governments and funders are just a few of the huge and frequently complex projects that must be managed in order to reach these goals. Concurrent with these efforts, research is also necessary because the pathophysiology of these illnesses in these settings is not fully understood and is changing as a result of our treatments. For many of these objectives to be accomplished, efficient information management is necessary. Concerns have been raised that the lack of resources and expertise in underdeveloped nations will make it difficult to treat diseases like HIV and drug-resistant tuberculosis on a broad scale (MDR-TB). EMR systems in poorer nations could be advantageous however, EMR systems have demonstrated to be practical in poor nations, the issue of scarce resources raises a number of concerns. Do EMRs have a significant positive impact on healthcare initiatives? Is this application of information technology (IT) feasible outside of a handful of well-funded experimental sites? Does it enhance the management of these healthcare companies or patient care? What information can we share with other healthcare organizations to help them choose the most effective and durable EMR system technology for these environments? Information system setup costs have significantly decreased as a result of rapid IT advancements. A $100 laptop PC is currently being developed, according to recent plans. Numerous developing nations, including Ghana, Peru, and others, now have reasonably widespread access to the internet, and there are many reliable and adaptable technologies available to manage data, such as mobile phones and personal digital assistants (PDAs). The primary driver of healthcare information systems in underdeveloped nations has been the requirement to provide aggregate statistics to the government or financing organizations. Simple paper forms can be used for data collection at the clinic level, and all computerized data input is done centrally, but that method is typically challenging and time-consuming, and it may give the staff collecting the data little to no feedback. 
Clinical management can be assisted by individual patient data that is gathered and available at the point of care. Clinicians only need to simple technologies can be added to warn of potential issues in the future, access historical records, including drug interactions. In addition to doing research, doctors and nurses can monitor the progress of specific patients or groups of patients. Electronic health records (EHRs) have gained widespread use in recent years, and this has resulted in a vast number of clinical data that may be used for secondary research purposes. In fact, supporting the gathering and evaluation of "huge data" produce valuable insights has frequently been cited as a basis for the implementation of EHR. The development of efficient methods for reusing clinical data from EHRs has garnered increasing interest from the clinical research community, in part because secondary data reuse has advantages over original data acquisition. When compared to conventional clinical research, researchers that use EHR data may not need to recruit new participants or gather fresh data. A patient's status, medical care, and illness development are commonly included in longitudinal data from EHRs as well. It has already been demonstrated that these data make it possible to support clinical decision-making, extract medical concepts, make diagnoses, and estimate risk. Reusing EHR data can present some difficulties, though, particularly given its complexity and variability. Patient data in electronic health records (EHRs) for ophthalmology patients, for instance, may comprise fields as diverse as demographic data, diagnoses, laboratory test results, prescriptions, eye exams, imaging, and surgery records. Machine learning algorithms and, more broadly, artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms need methods like information extraction, dimension reduction, and predictive modeling to assess these varied inputs. In many different fields, using AI to analyze EHR data has been successful.
For example, research in cardiology have extensively employed AI approaches with EHR data to identify heart failure earlier, to improve risk assessment in individuals with suspected coronary artery disease and forecast the development of congestive heart failure. Similar methods have been used in ophthalmology to assess the risk of diabetic retinopathy, improve the detection of glaucoma, age-related macular degeneration (AMD), and predict risks of complications from cataract surgery using machine learning classifiers and EHR data (DR) (William 2018). Although the use of AI in EHR data for ocular disorders has grown over the past ten years, there haven't been any published reviews of the relevant literature. A 2017 literature analysis on the topic of machine learning in ophthalmology identified publications that mostly concentrated on applying the technology to evaluate imaging data as opposed to EHR data. This paper fills this knowledge gap by doing a literature analysis and applying AI to analyze EHR data for the diagnosis and monitoring of eye diseases. We examine the many AI methodologies employed, their effectiveness, and how AI has been utilized to treat particular ocular disorders in this review, offering future prospects for clinical practice and research. Electronic health record systems mainly through the accessibility of health information have the potential to raise the caliber of healthcare services. There has been an alarmingly high failure rate when implementing EHR systems in healthcare settings. The literature describing obstacles to implementing an EHR system is reviewed in this essay. 
Prior to determining whether a system is ready, the hurdles must be identified. According to the PRISMA criteria, a structured literature review was conducted. The information systems resources were used to categorize the identified impediments. People resources (user resistance and a lack of expertise), as well as process resources, are the key issues that need to be addressed, according to the evaluation (concern for return on investment and a lack of administrative and policy support). Additional research is needed to explore the obstacles in depth and determine how to overcome them (Christensen 2008). In order to increase the effectiveness, accessibility, and quality of healthcare services, information and communication technologies are currently being deployed in healthcare settings. 
Electronic medical record (EMR) systems are regarded as one of the major healthcare game-changers and a key component of health information systems among these technologies. EMR systems are anticipated to enhance patient care from a care perspective, ensuring the accuracy of patient care information contained in health records, enhancing patient healthcare information accessible for continuity of care across space and time, and supporting clinical decision-making. EMR systems provide the managerial ability to produce health care statistics that are crucial for managing and planning health services, enhancing the caliber of routine health data in health systems. Since more than ten years ago, it has been investigated how EMR systems are used and implemented in poor countries. Among the reported advantages of using this technology are lowered patient waiting times, lowered medicine ordering mistakes, directing medical protocols, and streamlining the creation of necessary reports for higher authorities. The use of free and open source software is also promoted as a way to avoid paying licensing fees to maintain the system because developing countries' limited healthcare budgets make this expensive. Many free and open source EMR systems have been developed as a result.
A collection of electronically preserved data about a person's health state and medical treatment has been referred to by various names, comprising electronic medical records (EMR), electronic patient records (EPR), computer-based patient records (CPR), and electronic health records (EHR). While the terms EMR, EPR, and CPR frequently refer to records implemented at a single or several related healthcare institutions, EHR is frequently associated with a record containing all the personal health information of an individual throughout their lifetime, entered (or accepted) and accessible by healthcare providers distributed on multiple sites, including all ambulatory care settings at which the patient receives care. National health systems' ultimate objective is the EHR in this regard as it is a consolidated, integrated record. Personal health records, which are comparable to electronic health records but are handled by the individual rather than by medical facilities, are another related phrase that has recently evolved.
Medical records whether they are kept on paper or electronically, have several uses in the healthcare industry. They serve to establish a foundation for the historical record, facilitate provider contact, foresee potential health issues, document standard preventative measures, spot deviations from predicted patterns, provide a record for the law and support medical research. However, there are drawbacks to using paper for medical documents, including the possibility of being inaccessible when being used by another person or if they are misplaced, the possibility of missing data due to a health provider's oversight, the difficulty of reading the data, the growth of the records' size with time, redundant data being recorded in many locations, and the laboriousness of data extraction for clinical research. EMRs are consequently thought of as a remedy for these deficiencies in paper-based recordkeeping (Aaronson 2001).

        Medical personnel have recorded a variety of "notes" in a medical record system over time, including observations, medication and therapy administration, prescriptions for such administration, test and imaging results, reports, etc. Basic information like your name and birth date might be found in your medical records. They also comprise the details you divulge to your general practitioner, dentist, or other professional when they examine you. Admission, on-service, progress, operations, postoperative notes, procedures, delivery, postpartum, and discharge are all documented in the typical medical record for inpatient treatment. We conducted an observational study at our colleges’ medical center to determine the success with which nurse’s finds patient information using traditional hospital/medical records as the source of data (Sood, 2008).

        An alternative to paper-based records is the use of electronic medical records. They are also a source of data that may be used into other procedures to deal with a variety of healthcare problems. A "medical record," "health record," or "medical chart" is a term used to describe the systematic documentation of a single patient's medical history and care across time, under the supervision of a single health care professional. A health care facility may use medical records technology, often known as health information technology. Understanding the contents of patient records, gathering data, applying statistical techniques, understanding medico legal considerations, and knowledge of relevant statutory laws are necessary for maintaining a solid health information system.  
        The above is a standard flow chart of an electronic medical record system, bur based on this project, we are only focusing on the RECORD KEEPING and CONSULTATION aspects and we’re creating a DEMO VERSION of this so as to aid fast completion of this project and easy comprehension of our objectives.
